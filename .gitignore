# An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become included 
# again. It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded. Git doesnâ€™t list excluded
# directories for performance reasons, so any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are defined.
# Put a backslash ("\") in front of the first "!" for patterns that begin with a literal "!", for example, "\!important!.txt".
